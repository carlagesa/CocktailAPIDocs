# Webhooks

In this guide, we will look at how to register and consume webhooks to integrate your app with the Cocktail API. With webhooks, your app can receive real-time notifications about changes or events related to cocktails, ingredients, and more. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Registering Webhooks

To register a new webhook, you need to have a URL in your app that the Cocktail API can call. You can configure a new webhook via the Cocktail API dashboard under [Webhook Settings](#). Give your webhook a name, select the [events](#event-types) you want to receive notifications for, and provide your webhook URL.

Once registered, the Cocktail API will send a webhook request to your URL whenever an event of interest occurs. In the next section, we'll cover how to consume and handle these webhook requests.

## Consuming Webhooks

When your app receives a webhook request from the Cocktail API, check the `type` attribute to determine the event that triggered the webhook. The `type` will specify the event, such as a new cocktail or ingredient update.

```json {{ title: 'Example webhook payload' }}
{
  "id": "abc123",
  "type": "cocktail.updated",
  "payload": {
    "id": "cocktail_001",
    "name": "Mojito",
    "ingredients": ["Mint", "Lime", "Sugar", "Rum"],
    "updated_at": "2024-08-24T12:34:56Z"
  }
}
```

In the example above, a conversation was `updated`, and the payload type is a `conversation`.

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button href="#event-types" variant="text" arrow="right">
    <>See all event types</>
  </Button>
</div>

## Security

To know for sure that a webhook was, in fact, sent by Cocktail API instead of a malicious actor, you can verify the request signature. Each webhook request contains a header named `x-protocol-signature`, and you can verify this signature by using your secret webhook key. The signature is an HMAC hash of the request payload hashed using your secret key. Here is an example of how to verify the signature in your app:

<CodeGroup title="Verifying a request">

```js
const signature = req.headers['x-cocktail-signature']
const hash = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret).update(payload).digest('hex')

if (hash === signature) {
  // Request is verified
} else {
  // Request could not be verified
}

```

```python
from flask import request
import hashlib
import hmac

signature = request.headers.get("x-cocktail-signature")
hash = hmac.new(bytes(secret, "ascii"), bytes(payload, "ascii"), hashlib.sha256)

if hash.hexdigest() == signature:
    # Request is verified
else:
    # Request could not be verified

```

```php
$signature = $request['headers']['x-cocktail-signature'];
$hash = hash_hmac('sha256', $payload, $secret);

if (hash_equals($hash, $signature)) {
  // Request is verified
} else {
  // Request could not be verified
}

```

</CodeGroup>

If your generated signature matches the `x-protocol-signature` header, you can be sure that the request was truly coming from Cocktail API. It's essential to keep your secret webhook key safe â€” otherwise, you can no longer be sure that a given webhook was sent by Cocktail API. Don't commit your secret webhook key to GitHub!
